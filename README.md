# Reacting

A collection of React learning projects, each demonstrating different concepts and techniques.

I'm building these apps to learn React from the ground up. Each project is a self-contained application that focuses on specific React features or patterns. While simple, they're designed with best practices and well-documented code, which might also help others learning React.

All apps are hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://reacting.thehww.app/](https://reacting.thehww.app/)
