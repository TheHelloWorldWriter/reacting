# Reacting

A collection of React learning projects, each demonstrating different concepts and techniques.

I'm building these apps to learn React from the ground up. Each project is a self-contained application that focuses on specific React features or patterns. While simple, they're designed with best practices and well-documented code, which might also help others learning React.

All apps are hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://reacting.thehww.app/](https://reacting.thehww.app/)

## Projects

### [Hello, React!](./hello-react)

An interactive greeting app demonstrating React state management and event handlers.

**What I learned:**
- Component state with `useState`
- Props and event handlers
- TypeScript with React
- Tailwind CSS integration
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Tech stack

All projects use:
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite 8** for fast builds and development
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling
- Modern build tools and optimizations

## About
